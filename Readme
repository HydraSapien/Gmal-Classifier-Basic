Custom classifier program to connect to Gmail and generate a report on all unread emails by their sender involves several steps. Below is a Python script that uses the Gmail API to achieve this. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and the Gmail API enabled for your Google account.

  Prerequisites:

Google Cloud Project: You need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Gmail API.
OAuth 2.0 Credentials: Download the credentials.json file for OAuth 2.0 client IDs.
Python Libraries: Install the required libraries using pip.

pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

  Step-by-Step Script:
1) Setup the Gmail API Client
2) Fetch Unread Emails
3) Classify and Create Report

How to Run

1) Authenticate: The authenticate_gmail function handles OAuth authentication, storing tokens for future use.
2) Fetch Unread Emails: The get_unread_emails function retrieves all unread emails.
3) Extract Sender Information: The get_message_details function extracts the sender's email address from each unread email.
4) Create Report: The create_report function aggregates the count of unread emails by sender and prints the report.

Notes:
1) Place the credentials.json file in the same directory as your script.
2) The first time you run the script, it will prompt you to authorize access to your Gmail account.
3) The script creates a token.json file to store the access and refresh tokens.

This script provides a basic framework to classify and report unread emails by sender. You can further enhance it by adding error handling, logging, and more advanced classification logic as needed.
